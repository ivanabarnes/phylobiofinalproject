/gene="LOC100184865"
/note="Derived by automated computational analysis using
gene prediction method: Gnomon."
/db_xref="GeneID:100184865"

fasta file called tunicate_LOC100184865.fasta

manually converted to phylip format --- tunicate_LOC100184865.phy
manually duplicated the gene --- tunicate_LOC100184865_duplicated.phy

created a fake tree to test this on -- cyclo.tre

created a file for seqgen with the ancestral sequence --- cyclo.phy
created a job file for seqgen --- job_seqgen.sh

submitted batch job

output: cyclo_jc_sim.fasta

manually broke apart "paralogs" --- cyclo_jc_sim_paralogs_sep.fasta

72 per line - 2526 total 
35 lines, 6 bases

chose 1st paralog for everything except lampreys and hagfish --- cyclo_jc_sim_one_paralog.fasta

created job file for iqtree --- job_iqtree.sh

submitted batch job

output: cyclo_jc_sim_one_paralog.fasta.treefile and cyclo_jc_sim_one_paralog.fasta.contree

***these didn't show the relationships at all, I think the mu is too big and the sequences are getting saturated

chose 1st paralog for everything --- cyclo_jc_sim_one_paralog_all_first.fasta

created job file for iqtree --- job_iqtree_all_first.sh

output: cyclo_jc_sim_one_paralog_all_first.fasta.treefile and cyclo_jc_sim_one_paralog_all_first.fasta.contree

***these didn't represent the relationships accurately either, but hagfish and lamprey did seem slightly further away

***in these there was a significant difference -> the one with the paralogs switched found a monophyletic cyclostome with super long branch lengths
***to continue with this I will start playing around with different parameters such as branch lengths, 
    and possibly other combinations of gene loss, to see if this is always relevant
